9. copy the "token" and paste it into the config file
```json
{
    "token": "right here :)"
```
10. format the quotes so that they each are a seperate line
```
quote 1
quote 2
quote 3
(no quotations)
```
11. got to http://textmechanic.com/text-tools/basic-text-tools/add-prefixsuffix-into-line/ and paste your quotes into the text box
12. put `"` in the prefix box and `",` into the suffix box, this shoud format your quotes like this
```
"quote 1",
"quote 2",
"quote 3",
```
13. paste it into the quote section in the config file. your config shoould now look like this:
```json
{
    "prefix": "prefix",
    "command": "command",
    "token": "token",
    "quotes":["quote 1",
    "quote 2",
    "quote 3",]
}
```
now remove the comma from the very last line.
14. create a discord invite by pasting your bot `Client Id` into where it says CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE in this link: 
```
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=2097176631 
```
a box should pop up asking you to invite the bot to your discord server. choose which server you want and hit ok
